## Overview

Simple Shooter is a game developed using the Unreal Engine 5. The objective of the game is to shoot down enemies while avoiding their attacks and try to remain hidden whilst doing so because of the AI I developed that sets different states in the enemies and if you intercept their field of view they enter the "Hunter" mode.
